\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Introduction}
This book contains reference notes on undergraduate mathematics, intended for review. None of the results are original, and only a few proofs are original. Most proofs are presented informally, with just enough information to convey the idea.

Currently there is some inconsistency in the presentation. Definitions are not included with the abstract algebra material (groups, rings, and fields), and neither definitions nor techniques are included with the logic and computability material. Also, the set theory material is presented in a detailed lecture format. The book will be normalized over time.
