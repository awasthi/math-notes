\section{Computable Functions}
\begin{thm}
The class~\(\CC\) of computable functions contains the basic functions and is closed under substitution, primitive recursion, and minimalization. (In particular, \(\PAR\subseteq\CC\) where \(\PAR\)~is the class of partial recursive functions.)
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}[Proof concept]
Exhibit URM programs for each of the basic functions, and each of the operations.
\end{proof}
\begin{app}
Establishing computability of a large class of common functions.
\end{app}
